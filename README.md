# Farming mod

## Overview
This mod is designed to replace minecraft's default farming system, adding new crops and cooking mechanics to expand upon existing ideas and reward players with engaging with this mechanic.

## Ideas
- Stared Crops (Crops have a chance of dropping different qualities which can be used in cooking for different bonuses)
- New cooking system (Replace cooking with a furnace or smoker and add new cooking stations like a stove and oven which players can use different recipes to create new foods)
- Food bonuses add new effects and bonuses granted by different foods.


### Stations

- Stove
- Oven
- Press
- Mill
